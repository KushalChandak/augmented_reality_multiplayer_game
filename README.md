Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world
environment whose elements are &quot;augmented&quot; by computer-generated or
extracted real-world sensory input such as sound, video, graphics, or GPS data. It
is related to a more general concept called computer-mediated reality, in which a
view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a
computer.

Augmented reality enhances oneâ€™s current perception of reality.
Our aim is to create the space shooting game. It&#39;s a highly immersive,
photorealistic, binaural, AUGMENTED REALITY survival shooting game for
mobile devices. Gameplay takes place at home, office, open space wherever you
want.
